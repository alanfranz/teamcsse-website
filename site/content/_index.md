    There's a widespread acknowledgement that the tech sector suffer a skill gap
    - many fresh graduates that hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and
    Software Engineering seem totally untrained for their job, when they enter
    the industry. Some universities even devised some special courses to teach
    what they call "real-world skills", but they're far from common.


    We asked ourselves: Why? Why is that? What do students, university, and
    employers, expect from fresh graduates?

#    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
#    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
#    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
#    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
